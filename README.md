Investigation of Australian maximum temperature variance
++

Melbourne's maximum temperature on the 6th of January 2017 was 41.7 °C and the forecast maximum for the 7th of January 2017 is 22°C. This got me to wondering how big of drop in maximum daily temperature has occurred between days in the past.

The Jupyter notebook summary of what I found: https://github.com/amacd31/data_analysis_notebooks/blob/master/Maximum%20temperature%20daily%20variance%20investigation.ipynb

Staff Working From Office or Home (Melbourne, Australia), (In response to the COVID-19 outbreak)
++

The company I work for has very flexible working arrangements, to work from
home rather than the office you just need to let your team know at the start of
the day. I'm part of a group of around 25 people that post their work from
office/home intentions as emojis on a daily slack reminder. I collated those
emoji intentions into `wfo_wfh_data.csv` (with an other column denoting non
wfh/wfo related emoji).

With the outbreak of COVID-19 company policy evolved quickly as the number of
cases in Australia increased. Beginning with the recommendation on the 12th of
March that people work from home and switching to mandating everyone works from
home from the 16th of March.

This notebook presents the transition from more people working in the office to
everyone working from home over the space of a little over 6 weeks:
