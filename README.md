Investigation of Australian maximum temperature variance
++

Melbourne's maximum temperature on the 6th of January 2017 was 41.7 °C and the forecast maximum for the 7th of January 2017 is 22°C. This got me to wondering how big of drop in maximum daily temperature has occurred between days in the past.
